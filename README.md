## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a second year student at Kritiania University in Bergen. This is my github where I publish both personal projects and school projects that I have completed during my education. 

I study Frontend and mobile development. We learn both frontend and backend during our bachelor degree as well as app development. 
I started my education in 2024 and I am finished in 2027.
